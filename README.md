# Two SEC-DED Codes in python

Python mplentation of Hsiao and Lala secded scheme to protect 64-bit data

Taken from Hsiao 1970 paper, usign Figure 6 as parity check matrix, for Hsiao codes

Taken from Lala's set of papers from 2003 to 2007, with some hacking due to not being able to correctly characterize the different types of error when using the procedure described in the paper.
